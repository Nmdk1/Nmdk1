# Michael Shaffer

Builder focused on real-world systems, developer leverage, and explainable tooling.

## What I’m working on
I’m currently building **StrideIQ**, an AI-powered running intelligence platform that turns raw training data into causal, athlete-specific insight.

StrideIQ was built **100% inside the Cursor desktop IDE** as a hands-on experiment in agentic coding workflows. What started as curiosity quickly became a production-grade system used to explore:

- how AI tools behave under real constraints  
- where agentic workflows fail  
- how to design guardrails that preserve correctness and user trust  

The product is currently in closed beta and preparing for a **provisional patent filing**, so the core codebase remains private.

## How I build
- Daily, intensive use of AI coding tools (Cursor-first)
- Strong bias toward shipping, testing, and validating assumptions
- Comfortable rejecting plausible AI output when it violates system invariants
- Focus on explainability, not black-box output

## About me
- Physicist by training  
- Former healthcare IT founder (scaled and exited)  
- Competitive endurance athlete  
- Currently focused on building, learning, and helping others gain leverage through better tools  

Code samples or architecture walkthroughs are available upon request.
